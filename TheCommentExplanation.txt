in the comment code refactoring, the code has
some obvious yet unnecesary explanation in the
code, which it makes the code confusing to read.
the solution to this problem is by using the 
extract method to get rid of the comment and
change the parameters to make it look more
obvious than using comments to give unecessary
explanation to the code.
